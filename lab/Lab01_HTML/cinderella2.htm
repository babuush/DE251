      Once there was a gentleman who married, for his second wife, the proudest
      and most haughty woman that was ever seen. She had, by a former husband,
      two daughters of her own humor, who were indeed exactly like her in all
      things. He had likewise, by another wife, a young daughter, but of
      unparalleled goodness and sweetness of temper, which she took from her
      mother, who was the best creature in the world. No sooner were the
      ceremonies of the wedding over but the step-mother began to show herself
      in her colors. She could not bear the good qualities of this pretty girl;
      and the less because they made her own daughters appear the more odious.
      She employed her in the meanest work of the house; she scoured the dishes
      and tables, and cleaned madam's room and the rooms of misses, her
      daughters; she lay up in a sorry garret, upon a wretched straw-bed, while
      her sisters lay in fine rooms, with floors all inlaid, upon beds of the
      very newest fashion, and where they had looking-glasses so large that they
      might see themselves at their full length, from head to foot. The poor
      girl bore all patiently, and dared not tell her father, who would have
      rattled her off, for his wife governed him entirely. When she had done her
      work, she used to go into the chimney corner and sit down among cinders
      and ashes, which made her commonly called Cinder-wench; but the youngest,
      who was not so rude and uncivil as the eldest, called her Cinderella.
      However, Cinderella, notwithstanding her mean apparel, was a hundred times
      handsomer than her sisters, though they were always dressed very richly.
      It happened that the king's son gave a ball, and invited all persons of
      fashion to it. Our young misses were also invited, for they cut a very
      grand figure among the quality. They were mightily delighted at this
      invitation, and wonderfully busy in choosing out such gowns, petticoats,
      and head-clothes as might best become them. This was a new trouble to
      Cinderella, for it was she who ironed her sisters' linen and plaited their
      ruffles. They talked all day long of nothing but how they should be
      dressed. "For my part," said the eldest, "I will wear my red velvet suit
      with French trimmings." "And I," said the youngest, "shall only have my
      usual petticoat; but then, to make amends for that, I will put on my gold
      flowered manteau and my diamond stomacher, which is far from being the
      most ordinary one in the world." They sent for the best tire-woman they
      could get to make up their head-dresses, and they had their patches from
      the very best maker. Cinderella was likewise called up to them to be
      consulted in all these matters, for she had excellent notions and advised
      them always for the best; nay, and offered her service to dress their
      heads, which they were very willing she should do. As she was doing this,
      they said to her, "Cinderella, would you not be glad to go to the ball?"
      "Ah!" said she, "you only jeer at me; it is not for such as I am to go
      thither." "Thou art in the right of it," replied they; "it would make the
      people laugh to see a cinder-wench at a ball." Anyone but Cinderella would
      have dressed their heads awry, but she was very good, and dressed them
      perfectly well. They were almost two days without eating, so much they
      were transported with joy. They broke above a dozen of laces in trying to
      be laced up close, that they might have a fine slender shape, and they
      were continually at their looking-glass. At last the happy day came. They
      went to court, and Cinderella followed them with her eyes as long as she
      could, and when she had lost sight of them, she fell a-crying. Her
      godmother, who saw her all in tears, asked her what was the matter. "I
      wish I could—I wish I could—"; she was not able to speak the rest, being
      interrupted by her tears and sobbing. This godmother of hers, who was a
      fairy, said to her, "Thou wishest thou couldest go to the ball. Is it not
      so?" "Y—es," cried Cinderella with a great sigh. "Well," said her
      godmother, "be but a good girl, and I will contrive that thou shalt go."
      Then she took her into her chamber and said to her, "Run into the garden
      and bring me a pumpkin." Cinderella went immediately to gather the finest
      she could get, and brought it to her godmother, not being able to imagine
      how this pumpkin could make her go to the ball. Her godmother scooped out
      all the inside of it, having left nothing but the rind; which done, she
      struck it with her wand, and the pumpkin was instantly turned into a fine
      coach, gilded all over with gold. She then went to look into her
      mouse-trap, where she found six mice, all alive, and ordered Cinderella to
      lift up a little the trap-door. Then she gave each mouse, as it went out,
      a little tap with her wand, and the mouse was that moment turned into a
      fair horse. All together the mice made a very fine set of six horses of a
      beautiful mouse-colored dapple-gray. Being at a loss for a coachman, "I
      will go and see," said Cinderella, "if there be never a rat in the
      rat-trap, that we may make a coachman of him." "Thou art in the right,"
      replied her godmother; "go and look." Cinderella brought the trap to her,
      and in it there were three huge rats. The fairy made choice of one of the
      three, which had the largest beard, and, having touched him with her wand,
      he was turned into a fat, jolly coachman, who had the smartest whiskers
      that eyes ever beheld. After that her godmother said to her, "Go again
      into the garden and you will find six lizards behind the watering pot;
      bring them to me." She had no sooner done so, than the fairy turned them
      into six footmen, who skipped up immediately behind the coach, with their
      liveries all bedecked with gold and silver, and clung as close behind each
      other as if they had done nothing else their whole lives. The fairy then
      said to Cinderella, "Well, you see here an equipage fit to go to the ball
      with. Are you not pleased with it?"
